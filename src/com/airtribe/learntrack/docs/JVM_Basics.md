1. What is JDK, JRE, JVM?
    a. JDK: The JDK is a software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes tools required to write, compile, debug, and run Java programs, such as the Java compiler (`javac`), debugger, and the JRE.
    b. JRE: The JRE provides the environment required to run Java applications. It includes the JVM and core Java libraries but does not contain development tools like the compiler.
    c. JVM: The JVM is responsible for executing Java bytecode. It converts bytecode into machine-specific instructions and manages memory, garbage collection, and thread execution. JVM implementations are platform-dependent.

2. What is bytecode
   Bytecode is the intermediate code generated by the Java compiler after compiling a `.java` file. It is stored in `.class` files and is platform-independent. The JVM interprets or compiles this bytecode into machine code at runtime.

3. What does “write once, run anywhere” mean?
   “Write Once, Run Anywhere” means that Java programs can be written and compiled once and then executed on any operating system that has a compatible JVM. The Java compiler generates platform-independent bytecode, which can be run on different platforms without modification.
    This is possible because each operating system has its own JVM implementation that understands Java bytecode and translates it into native machine instructions, allowing Java applications to be portable across platforms.
